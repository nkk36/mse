This is a repository for a Shiny application that runs [Multiple System Estimation](https://hrdag.org/2013/03/11/mse-the-basics/) (MSE) models on artificially generated data. MSE is a methodology for statistical inference and is often used for estimating the size of a population of interest. It uses overlap of incomplete lists to estimate the population size. This application is meant to be educational allowing the user to generate different size data sets and lists. There are also options for creating list dependencies and unequal probability of capture. The application was created using R Shiny.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. Below you will find a list of packages and their versions used to create the application.

### Prerequisites

Here is a list of packages which you will need to run the application. You will also need all of their package dependencies as well. **This application was created using R 3.4.3.**

| Packages        | Version |
| --------------- |:-------:|
| dplyr           | 0.7.4   |
| formattable     | 0.2.0.1 |
| ggplot2         | 2.2.1   |
| Rcapture        | 1.4-2   |
| scales          | 0.5.0   |
| shiny           | 1.0.5   |
| shinydashboard  | 0.6.1   |
| VennDiagram     | 1.6.18  |

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
